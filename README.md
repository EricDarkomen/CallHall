# Call of Duty: Customer Service

A call centre RPG. Answer the phones, survive the shift, and find out who writes
the numbers.

You are a new trainee at CALLHALL Services plc. There are thirteen rooms, twenty
colleagues, fourteen mugs, and a fourth floor that is not on the floor plan.
Difficult calls are turn-based: your **Patience** is your health, their
**Frustration** is what you are reducing.

Play it in a browser. A page, its content, and a directory of art — no build
step, no dependencies, no network calls.

## Running it

Open `index.html`, or serve the folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Controls

|            | Keyboard                        | Touch                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Move       | `W A S D` or arrows             | thumb down anywhere bottom-left |
| Interact   | `E`                             | `E` button                     |
| Dialogue   | `Space`, `1`–`9` to choose      | tap the box, tap a reply       |
| Panels     | `J I K C M P L`, `Esc` for menu | `☰`                            |
| Save/load  | `F5` / `F9`                     | `☰` · Menu                     |

On a phone the movement control is a floating analogue stick: it appears
wherever your thumb lands in the bottom-left of the screen, goes in every
direction rather than four, and how far you push it is how fast you walk. A
four-way d-pad is available instead, and the whole layout mirrors for
left-handers — both are in `☰ · Menu`, along with a fullscreen toggle. Starting
a shift asks for fullscreen on its own.

The game saves itself, and detects touch devices to show the right controls and
the right instructions.

## Repository layout

This is the **private** repository: full history and staging. The public repo is
rebuilt from it as a single commit containing only the released files — see
`scripts/release.sh`. Nothing else here is ever published.

The game is `index.html` — the engine — plus the files it loads:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `data/*.js` | The content: people and dialogue, items, callers, the office, and what happens when you press E. |
| `art/sprites/*.png` | The character and world art. Third-party, separately licensed. |
| `art/sprites/manifest.js` | Generated: the rectangles that describe those PNGs. |
| `tools/build-sprites.mjs` | Builds the sheets and the manifest, and touches nothing else. |
| `editor.html`, `editor/` | A level editor. Not the game, and never published. |

They are plain scripts rather than ES modules on purpose. A module is fetched,
and a `file://` page cannot fetch — this way opening the page straight off disk
still works, which is a thing the test suite checks. Nothing reads pixels back
out of a canvas either, for the same reason.

Keep the folder together when you copy the game somewhere. `data/` is the game;
`art/` is required by the licence, and without it everybody in the office turns
back into an emoji.

```sh
node tools/build-sprites.mjs            # rebuild every sheet and the manifest
node tools/build-sprites.mjs office     # rebuild one sheet
node tools/build-sprites.mjs --check    # fail if the committed output is stale
```

## The level editor

Serve the folder and open `editor.html` — its own page, deliberately, so the game
itself is untouched and loads nothing from it. It draws the level with the game's
own renderer, so what you see is what the player gets.

It is published beside the game, at
<https://ericdarkomen.github.io/CallHall/editor.html>.

Draw rooms, place doors and counters, move the furniture, set the arrival points
and the links between levels. It checks the level on every edit — the one that
matters counts how many separate pieces the walkable floor is in, which is the
class of fault you cannot see on screen and that has shipped here before. Then it
writes the source back out for you to paste into `data/levels.js` and
`data/world.js`.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000    # then http://localhost:8000/editor.html
```

## Licence

Two parts, because there are two kinds of thing here. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

**The game** — code, writing, characters, design. Copyright © 2026 Grant van Zyl,
licensed [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) —
share and link it freely, but not commercially and not modified.

**The character sprites** are not ours. They are pixel art from the
[Liberated Pixel Cup](https://lpc.opengameart.org/) community, used under
[OGA-BY 3.0](https://static.opengameart.org/OGA-BY-3.0.txt) and **modified**
(composited, recoloured, cropped). Artists and sources are listed in
[art/CREDITS.md](art/CREDITS.md). That art is *not* covered by the game's
NonCommercial or NoDerivatives terms — the PNGs in `art/sprites/` are the clean
copies to take if you want them.

Only assets offered under OGA-BY 3.0 or CC0 were used, deliberately: neither
carries a ShareAlike term, so using them costs attribution and nothing else.
`tools/build-sprites.mjs` re-checks that against upstream's own licence data on
every build and refuses to produce a sheet if it stops being true.

A work of fiction; CALLHALL Services plc and everyone in it are invented.
"Call of Duty" is a trade mark of Activision Publishing, Inc. — this is an
unaffiliated parody about a call centre.
